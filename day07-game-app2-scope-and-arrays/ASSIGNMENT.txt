Basic (out of 10 points):

- Add all the features covered in day07 to your game app. Your game app should now
be getting input from a user via an HTML form, should output when a button is
clicked, and the output should be displayed on the page. 

- Your game should also clear the input box of any data when the user clicks the
button.

- Your game should inform the user that they need to input a number if they leave the textbox blank when clicking the submit button.

- Lastly, your app's JS should now also be contained inside an IIFE.


Extra points:

Try adding loops to your game to give the user 3 tries to guess the right number. We haven't covered loops yet so this will let you jump ahead and sharpen your Googling skills.
