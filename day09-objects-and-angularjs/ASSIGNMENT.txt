Imagine you've created an app that requires users to provide information about
themselves. Create objects to represent 4 users. Each user should have the
following properties:

name
username
age
location

Use object literal notation to create these objects. Then create a function with one parameter which logs the year a user was born when passed their age.  (For 
example, if the user is 45, your code should return 2017-45 in order to get the
year of birth.)
