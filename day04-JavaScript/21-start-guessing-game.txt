Your first project is to create a guessing game. The end result will be a game in which the computer generates a random number and the user tries to guess that number. You will then tell the user whether their guess was correct.

The concepts we covered today should be enough to get you started.  Do the following:

- Declare a variable called computerChoice and assign it the value of a randomly generated number.

- Declare a variable called userChoice and assign it the value of input taken from a user.  You can do this by setting the prompt() function as the value of this variable.

- Lastly, check if the userChoice and computerChoice are equal.
