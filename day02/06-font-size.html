		<!-- Another way to add CSS is by using the <style> element. Remember, the <style> element always goes inside the <head>. In this lesson, we'll use CSS to change text size. -->

		<h1>Change Font Sizes with CSS</h1>

		<p>This is normal text, so you have something to compare the styled text to.</p>

		<!-- Look at the styling for <ol>. 2em makes the size twice the size as the browser's setting for text. -->

		<ol>
			<li>Item one</li>
			<li>Item two</li>
			<li>Item three</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Look at the styling for <ul>. 300% makes the size thrice the size as the browser's setting for text. Both "em" and "%" are commonly used methods of setting font size. -->

		<ul>
			<li>This is three times the normal size</li>
			<li>This is three times the normal size</li>
			<li>This is three times the normal size</li>
		</ul>
