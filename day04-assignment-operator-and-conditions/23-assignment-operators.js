// When do we use them?
// ++ is used to increment values by 1
// -- is used to decrement values by 1

//The following 3 lines accomplish the same task

//The following 3 lines accomplish the same task

// += and -= are used for incrementing or decrementing by more than 1.

// The following lines accomplish the same task
var expenses = 10;
expenses += 50;
expenses = expenses + 50;

// The following lines accomplish the same task
var expenses = 10;
expenses -= 50;
expenses = expenses - 50;

// *= and /= are used the same way. They reasign the value of a variable by multiplying
// or dividing by the specified number.

// The following lines accomplish the same task
var expenses = 10;
expenses *= 5;
expenses = expenses * 5;

// The following lines accomplish the same task
var expenses = 10;
expenses /= 2;
expenses = expenses / 2;
