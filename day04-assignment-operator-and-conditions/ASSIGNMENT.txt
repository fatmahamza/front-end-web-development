Complete the following:

Create an alarm clock program. Send the user a confirmation saying 'Its 7am. 
Would you like to snooze?' If the user clicks ok, console.log 'Ok. Snoozing 
for 5 minutes.' If the user clicks cancel, console.log 'Get up and keep 
moving forward.'

Secondary Assignment:

Continue working on your guessing game. There are no specific instructions here.
If you've not yet completed the basic steps, complete them. If you have, add to
the game and make it as advanced as possible. If you can, add conditions. If you
feel comfortable jumping ahead, try to take input from users through the HTML 
<form> element and try displaying results through HTML elements instead of 
console.log() or an alert.
--- Make sure you complete the basic steps before making the game more advanced
--- by adding other features.
