Basic assignment graded out of 10:

Let's add a new feature to your guessing game. Right now, the computer generates a random
number and the user has to guess that number. The user only has one try to guess the
correct number. Let's add a feature that gives them 3 tries.  Use a loop to give the user
multiple tries.  If they guess the wrong number, they should receive a message telling
them that their guess is incorrect and tell them how many tries they have left.


Bonus question:

Log numbers 1-14.  But there's a twist:

-If the number is divisible by 3, log 'Fizz' instead of the number.
-If the number is divisible by 5, log 'Buzz' instead of the number.

To complete this, you will need to use a loop and use modulo (the % sign). Modulo was
covered on day 3 under the numbers lesson.
