We briefly discussed a new way to access your computer's Operating System - using your Mac Terminal (or
Babun if you have Windows). Here are some common commands we discussed.

cd
- Short for change directory

ls
- To list the items in a directory

mv
- To move a file or folder from one location to another
- Also used to rename files


We also discussed absolute vs relative path.  For example, you can list the items inside
a folder without being inside that specific folder.

Let's say I have a Repositories folder. Inside that, I have two folders - web-development and
my-game-app.  If I'm currently inside web-development I can list the items inside my-game-app
by writing

ls ../my-game-app
