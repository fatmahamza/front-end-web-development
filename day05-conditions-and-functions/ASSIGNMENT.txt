Add to your guessing game by using conditions. At this point
you should have the following completed:

- Declare a variable called computerChoice and assign it the
  value of a randomly generated number.

- Declare a variable called userChoice and assign it the
  value of a prompt asking the user to guess which number
  the computer selected.

- Create an if-else-if chain. One condition should check
  whether userChoice is equal to computerChoice and respond
  by telling them they won. 'else if' the guess is equal to
  an empty string, tell the user that they need to input a
  valid number. Lastly, if the user does anything other than
  respond with an empty string or provide a correct value,
  then alert them saying they need their answer is incorrect.
