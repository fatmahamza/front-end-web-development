Add to your guessing game by using conditions. At this point
you should have the following completed:

- Declare a variable called computerChoice and assign it the
  value of a randomly generated number.

- Declare a variable called userChoice and assign it the
  value of a prompt asking the user to guess which number
  the computer selected.

- Create an if-else-if chain. One condition should check
  whether userChoice is equal to computerChoice and respond
  by telling them they won. 'else if' the guess doesn't match,
  tell the user that they're incorrect. Lastly, if the user
  hasn't typed in any value, then alert them saying they need
  to input a number.
