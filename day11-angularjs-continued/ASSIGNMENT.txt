Create a LinkedIn profile. This is an ungraded assignment but doing it and allowing me to review
it with you in the last class will greatly boost your chances of finding employment in the field.

- Add a picture that shows your face. Make sure it's zoomed in enough that it doesn't show
  anything lower than your stomach. It should at least show your face and shoulders.

- Add tech-related skills. (CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Node)

- Add your classmates on LinkedIn

- Endorse each others' skills.

- If you already have a LinkedIn remove any skills that won't be helpful in the field of
  technology. If you're serious about entering the field of technology, you have to create 
  a brand here. You're showing that your main interest and passion is in technology. 
  Recruiters and potential employers are looking at your profile for 30 seconds before 
  making a decision.

- When writing about your work experiences try to emphasize any technical aspects of your
  roles.
