<!-- ng-app is a directive. Directives are markers on DOM elements. ng-app tells the 
     browser that this HTML file is an Angular application.-->

<!-- Directives can be attributes like ng-app or they can be HTML elements that render
     JS components. You can think of directives as instructions for Angular to describe
     what it should do to these elements or how they should be represented in the DOM.
