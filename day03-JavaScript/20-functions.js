// Functions allow us to wrap a piece of a program into a statement that we can just call. The
// data within the parenthesis is called an "argument". Here are some examples of functions:

console.log('Hello'); // This will simply print whatever is in parentheses 

alert('You must be 18 or older to make this purchase!'); // This will alert the user with 
														 // a pop-up

confirm('Are you 18?'); // This function will ask the user to confirm something by creating
						// a pop-up that they can say 'ok' or 'cancel' to.

prompt('Enter your age.'); // This function creates a pop-up asking the user for input.
